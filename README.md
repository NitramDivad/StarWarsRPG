# **JQuery Assigment - Star Wars RPG**

Week 04 Homework Assignment....

Star Wars RPG will be written using JQuery, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

The game will follow the general theme of Star Wars.  Following are Game Play notes:

    1.  Each character in the game has 3 attributes:  Health Points, Attack Power and Counter Attack Power.
    2.  Game play for the Player utilizes Health and Attack attributes.
    2.  Game play for the Enemy utilizes Health and Counter Attack attributes.
    3.  Player Attack increases by its base value with each successful attack.
    4.  Enemy Attack Power is static; it does not change.
    5.  Health is decreased for the Player by the enemy's Counter Attack value (it never recovers).
    6.  Health is decreased for the Enemy by the Player's Attack value (it never recovers).
    7.  When a Player or Enemy Health value reaches zero, that figher loses.
    8.  If an Enemy loses, the Player can continue by choosed another Enemy.
    9.  When a Player loses, or wins the game by defeating all enemies, the game can be Restarted.
    10. Hint:  A winning Player must pick their characters wisely by first fighting an Enemy with low `Counter Attack Power`. This will allow the Player to grind `Attack Power` and to take on Enemies before they lose all of their `Health Points`.
